In this package we understand how we can use threads to execute the task using multiple threads.

The NumberPrinter class is used to print numbers.
For every number we have created a new objecta of the calss NumebrPrinter and passed the same to run it on an
independent thread.

We have used Thread class in Main and ExeccutorServcie class in MainTwo (in this we have showcased thread pool implementation).

Note in the output you will find disparity in the output, the reason for that is the threads are not synchronized
and hence we face this issue.
